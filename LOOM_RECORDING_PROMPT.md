# ðŸŽ¥ Loom Recording Prompt: Climate Intelligence Hub

## ðŸ“‹ Recording Structure (5-7 minutes total)

### 1. Problem Statement (60-90 seconds)
**What specific problem exists in climate tech funding that you're addressing?**

"The climate investment market is worth $130 trillion, but investors struggle with three critical challenges:
- **Lack of standardized climate risk assessment** - Every firm uses different methodologies
- **Time-intensive due diligence** - Manual analysis takes weeks for each investment opportunity  
- **Fragmented data sources** - Climate data, financial metrics, and ESG scores exist in silos
- **Scenario planning complexity** - IPCC climate models are difficult to interpret for investment decisions

This creates a bottleneck where capital allocation decisions are delayed, inconsistent, and often miss critical climate risks."

### 2. Solution Overview (90-120 seconds)
**How does your Climate Intelligence Hub solve this problem?**

"Our platform is an AI-powered climate investment intelligence hub that transforms weeks of manual analysis into minutes of automated insights:

- **Unified Risk Assessment** - Combines physical climate risks, transition risks, and financial metrics in one dashboard
- **AI-Powered Analysis** - Machine learning algorithms process multiple data sources to generate investment-grade reports
- **IPCC Scenario Modeling** - Built-in climate projections (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 8.5) for stress testing portfolios
- **Portfolio Intelligence** - Multi-company comparison and sector diversification analysis
- **Real-time Integration** - Connects to live climate data, ESG databases, and financial APIs"

### 3. Live Demo (2.5-3 minutes)
**Show what you've built so far - focus on core functionality:**

1. **Business Profile Setup** (30 seconds)
   - "Let me show you how an investor would analyze a renewable energy company"
   - Select "Renewable Energy" sector
   - Input basic business metrics
   - Show real-time data validation

2. **AI Risk Analysis** (45 seconds)
   - "Watch as our AI processes multiple risk factors simultaneously"
   - Demonstrate the risk assessment generation

   - Show physical vs transition risk breakdown

3. **Investment Metrics Dashboard** (45 seconds)
   - "Here's where investors see the financial intelligence"
   - Show ESG scoring integration
   - Demonstrate investment recommendation engine
   - Highlight key performance indicators

4. **Portfolio Analysis** (45 seconds)
   - "For portfolio managers, we provide multi-company comparison"
   - Add multiple companies to portfolio
   - Show sector diversification analysis
   - Demonstrate risk distribution charts

5. **Climate Scenario Modeling** (30 seconds)
   - "Finally, stress test against IPCC climate scenarios"
   - Select different RCP scenarios
   - Show projected impacts over time horizons
   - Highlight portfolio resilience metrics

### 4. Next Steps & Roadmap (60 seconds)
**What you plan to build next to complete the solution:**

"To complete our MVP, we're building three additional modules:

1. **Due Diligence Automation** - Automated report generation with regulatory compliance
2. **Investor Dashboard** - Real-time portfolio monitoring with alerts and notifications  
3. **Climate Capital Integration** - Direct connection to climate funding databases and deal flow

Our goal is to become the Bloomberg Terminal for climate investments - the single source of truth that every climate investor relies on for decision-making."
